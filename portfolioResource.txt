In the world of Software Development, having a portfolio is an important
item to have. It allows an individual to showcase previous projects
and work completed to potential employers. Using GitHub allows the
individual to have the piece of mind of knowing that they can log
into GitHub and have access to their projects. They can also share a
link to potential employers ,so they can view their project in more detail,
and see the process behind how they approach writing code. It also serves
as a place where you can store previous versions in the event things
go wrong. Overall, this is a huge advantage for future job endeavors.
