When downloading the software for the class, I was stuck between
 2 IDEs. The IDE that I did not choose was Eclipse. I downloaded
 the program and to give it a test run ,and I was not a fan of the
 interface. The menus and controls were confusing which left me in
 with a feeling that it wasn't for me.
